# An Internal Validity Index Based on Density-involved Distance

## Requirement

The source code is written by Matlab r2016a. Versions lower than Matlab r2012a have not been tested.

## Simplest Demo

- RUN Ncut_test.m to determine the optimal partition from varied partitions(produced by Normalized cuts). 

`CVDD.m` includes Algorithm 1: CVDD in our paper.
`Ncut_test.m` as an example includes Algorithm 2: CVDD-OP in our paper.

### Parameters in CVDD

No need to tune.

### Datasets used

File `data_all20 ` includes 8 synthetic datasets and 12 real datasets used in the experiments of our paper.
